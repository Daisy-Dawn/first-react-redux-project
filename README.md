# React + Vite

This project is about Learning Redux with React, managing and updating states by building a retail shop handled by a shopkeeper which manages the states of his junk store, takes products from shelf and also restocks by quantity or by typing amount to be retsocked or ordered. It is a simple redux project that handles state management and also makes use of redux persist.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
